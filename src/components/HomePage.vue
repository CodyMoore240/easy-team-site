      <p>10/1917 vs Mighty Drunks (again)</p>
      <p>For the second time in a week, the 4-2-1 Rubber Puckies were matched up against the still winless Mighty Drunks. The Drunks have been the biggest disappointment this season after winning the Championship a session ago.  Desperately needing a win, the Drunks came out aggressive. Unfortunately, the Puckies scored the first goal and the Drunks were unable to take the lead for the rest of the game.</p>
      <p>Everyone expected this matchup to be chippy and it delivered. In the second, Kang and a member of the Drunks had to be separated and were given offsetting penalties. In the third, Starner was given a penalty for roughing in what appeared to be clear interference on the same Drunks player. Starner was later boarded by the same player. To cap it all off Armstrong took out a female member of the Drunks in the closing minutes. The player was quoted as saying "He had rage in his eyes. I was just minding my own business and he came at me like a mad man".</p>
      <p>The Rubbers were able to persevere and come out on top 5-3 improving their record to 5-2-1. The current 3 game win streak puts the Puckies right back in the divisional race with the Hogs and the Armadillos.</p>

      <p>*Goal was awarded to Starner but after review from the CincyAHL league office, it was determined that the puck went off of the stick of Kang.</p>
